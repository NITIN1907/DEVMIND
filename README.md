## **2️⃣ Final Code Review & Cleanup**

- **Refactor:**  
  Go through your code to refactor any duplicate logic or poorly named variables.
- **Comments:**  
  Add comments and JSDoc annotations where necessary.
- **Remove Unused Files:**  
  Delete any placeholder files or commented-out code.

## **3️⃣ Version Control & Tagging**

- **Commit Your Changes:**  
  Make sure your latest changes are committed to Git.
- **Version Tagging:**  
  Tag a release (e.g., `v1.0.0`) so you have a reference for your stable version.

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
